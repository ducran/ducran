# 👋 Hi there, I'm Ducran!

## 🚀 About Me

I'm a passionate developer, AI enthusiast, and tech entrepreneur working at the intersection of **software engineering**, **data science**, and **digital innovation**. I love solving real-world problems through **smart, scalable, and meaningful tech** — whether it's building SaaS apps, optimizing business processes with AI, or empowering communities through education and digital tools.

- 🔭 Currently building projects in **AI-powered SaaS**, **data-driven platforms**, and **e-learning technologies**.
- 🌱 Learning more about **MLOps**, **LLMs**, and **scalable architectures** (FastAPI, LangChain, cloud deployments).
- 💬 Ask me about: **Python**, **NLP**, **machine learning**, **React**, **No-code tools**, and **tech for impact**.
- 🧠 I co-lead initiatives like **YonVision** (tech education) and **Focus Digital** (digital transformation).
- ⚡ Fun fact: I once created a full-stack sanitation project with map integration for field teams — all from scratch!
